# Memory Card Game – Build Strom 2025 Hackathon Project

## 🚀 Project Idea

Kids learn best through visuals and interaction.  
So our idea combines **memory training** with **visual identification**.

Whenever a child matches two cards:
- The **name of the object** appears  
- The **sticker and picture** are shown  
- (Audio feature will be added in future update)

This helps children:
- Recognize everyday objects  
- Learn names easily  
- Improve memory and concentration
